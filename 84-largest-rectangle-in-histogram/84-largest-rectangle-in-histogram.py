"""
Use a ascending monotonic stack to keep track index and height. 
When the stack is not empty adn it encounters a number smaller than the top of the stack, we pop the stack. 

As we pop, we calculates the local max and replace with maxArea if bigger. localmax can be calculated as such: height * (i - index), where index = stack's top's index. The differences is the width of what it could make

When we add to the stack, instead of putting the actual index, we put the index of where it couldâ€™ve extended to backwards.

Time and Space = O(N)
